# Todo

## Basic functionality

- Order tiers by importance (main speaker(s) > interviewer > bystander(s)), and align overlaps from least important to most important
- Handle multiple main speakers

## Refactoring code

- Refactor overlaps



## Extensions

- If transcript passes all checks, have it upload (automatically? optionally?) to server or email to Dan
- Option to fill in dictionary entries
