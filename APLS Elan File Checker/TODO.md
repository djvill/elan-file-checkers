# Todo

## Basic functionality

- Allow multiple dictionaries
- Enforce comment tier being called "Comment" (case insensitive), not "Comments"
- Tidy up text


## Refactoring code

- Tidyverse
- Wrap main panel in `uiOutput()` to make it all easier to deal with
- Better data structures for uploaded files
- (Low priority) Deal with the NAs introduced by coercion in speakerNums and fileNums definitions


## Extensions

- If transcript passes all checks, have it upload (automatically? optionally?) to server or email to Dan
- Option to fill in dictionary entries
