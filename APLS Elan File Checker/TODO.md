# Todo

## Basic functionality

- Include Redactions in overlap checker
- Order tiers by importance (main speaker(s) > interviewer > bystander(s)), and align overlaps from least important to most important
- Handle multiple main speakers in tier checker
- Redactions annotations formatted correctly (potentially as step 4): standalone annotation on speaker tier with just "REDACT", matching annotation on Redactions tier


## Extensions

- If transcript passes all checks, have it upload (automatically? optionally?) to server or email to Dan
- Option to fill in dictionary entries
